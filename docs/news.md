# ðŸ“° What's new?

## 11.x

- **New Website**: There's a whole new website with a fresh look and improved documentation.
  Check it out at [https://lazy.folke.io](https://lazy.folke.io/).
  The GitHub `README.md` has been updated to point to the new website.
  The `vimdoc` contains all the information that is available on the website.

- **Spec Resolution & Merging**: the code that resolves a final spec from a plugin's fragments has been rewritten.
  This should be a tiny bit faster, but more importantly, fixes some issues and is easier to maintain.

- [Packages](https://lazy.folke.io/packages) can now specify their dependencies and configuration using one of:

  - **Lazy**: `lazy.lua` file
  - **Rockspec**: [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) `*-scm-1.rockspec` [file](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Rockspec-format)
  - **Packspec**: `pkg.json` (experimental, since the [format](https://github.com/neovim/packspec/issues/41) is not quite there yet)

  Related _lazy.nvim_ options:

  ```lua
  {
    pkg = {
      enabled = true,
      cache = vim.fn.stdpath("state") .. "/lazy/pkg-cache.lua",
      -- the first package source that is found for a plugin will be used.
      sources = {
        "lazy",
        "rockspec", -- will only be used when rocks.enabled is true
        "packspec",
      },
    },
    rocks = {
      enabled = true,
      root = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy-rocks",
      server = "https://nvim-neorocks.github.io/rocks-binaries/",
    },
  }
  ```

- Installing [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) is now as simple as:

  ```lua
  { "nvim-neorg/neorg", opts = {} }
  ```

- Packages are not limited to just Neovim plugins. You can install any **luarocks** package, like:

  ```lua
  { "https://github.com/lubyk/yaml" }
  ```

  Luarocks packages without a `/lua` directory are never lazy-loaded, since it's just a library.

- `build` functions or `*.lua` build files (like `build.lua`) now run asynchronously.
  You can use `coroutine.yield(status_msg)` to show progress.
  Yielding will also schedule the next `resume` to run in the next tick,
  so you can do long-running tasks without blocking Neovim.
