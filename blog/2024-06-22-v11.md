Learn about the new features and improvements in **lazy.nvim** v11.0

<!-- truncate -->

Lazy now automatically resolves specs from:

- a plugin's `lazy.lua` file
- a plugin's rockspec
- a plugin's packspec (experimental, since the format is not quite there yet)

This PR also includes a big rewrite of how a final spec is resolved based on a plugin's spec fragments.
Should be a tiny bit faster, but more importantly, fixes some issues and is easier to maintain.
